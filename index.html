Engine Exploration
Before taking this course, I had some experience with Unity, mainly experimenting briefly. Additionally, I frequently use AR platforms like TikTok’s Effect House and Meta’s Spark AR to create mini-games and interactive effects. These platforms, which incorporate elements of visual scripting, are similar to certain game engines in some ways. My background with these platforms was my initial motivation for taking this course. 

Exploring three game engines at the beginning of the course was my first real exposure to traditional game engines, and what a game engine even was. I thoroughly enjoyed exploring different types of engines by creating “schmup” games. It was overall very interesting to see the strengths and weaknesses of different game engines. That said, it was a bit daunting to think about developing my own engine after seeing these examples.

I particularly enjoyed using MIT Scratch, as it's great for teaching young learners about technology. It's an excellent tool for introducing kids to algorithmic thinking. I loved it so much that I'm leading a two-week Scratch workshop this summer for kids aged 8 and up at the childcare center where I work.


Engine Development
Beginning in week three, we embarked on the lengthy and continuous process of engine development. While I didn't fully complete my game engine as I had hoped and plan to finish it over the summer, the experience has been extremely rewarding. The structure of having the engine split into weekly assignments made the project more manageable. Although it was often stressful, the challenge was worthwhile, and I do not regret taking it on.

My favorite homework was the transition from a text-based engine to 2D. Seeing my engine come to life like that was incredibly exciting. However, that same assignment was also the toughest for me. I had a hard time at first with SDL. It was a big step up, but it was also very rewarding once I got everything working.

The schedule I followed for the first half of the semester was very productive for me. Since each assignment was so interesting, I was always excited to get started on the work. I would start the assignment within the first couple days it was released, reading over the spec and understanding what was to be implemented, taking notes on paper to come back to. Then, over the next 5 days I would implement the test suites in order.

However, due to unavoidable personal circumstances, I fell behind around Homework 5. From that point on, I was unable to maintain a consistent weekly development schedule.

For the most part, I think I managed to keep my code “DRY”. But overall, the organization of my code is lacking and I will be reorganizing it over the summer. 

I've utilized AI assistants, such as UM GPT 4, from time to time to accelerate my learning and development process. I found AI particularly helpful when dealing with linking issues related to external libraries. It was also effective for resolving simple debugging errors. The AI proved most beneficial when I needed quick solutions to specific technical problems. 

Custom Feature Development
The custom feature I've integrated into my game engine is an avatar builder that includes the option for camera input, allowing players to visually place themselves in the game. Players can customize their avatars at any point during gameplay, and toggle the camera at any point as well. Developers can provide libraries of customizable features that players can access through the avatar builder. These features include options such as skin color, hairstyle, outfits, eyes, and mouths. The avatars are constructed using a layered image system, which organizes different elements of the avatar into manageable, editable layers.

In my current work with social media AR, what excites me most is giving users the ability to interact with and customize their experiences. This inspired me to integrate similar functionality into my game engine. I have previously developed mini avatar builder games as social media effects for various companies and musicians, and I wanted to advance this concept by incorporating it into my game engine. This idea also led to the inclusion of a camera option in the engine, which resembles many interactive AR effects.

Moreover, while a game developed using my engine would require players to follow the developer’s rules to win, adding the avatar builder allows players to personalize their experience and see themselves within the game world. This feature not only enhances user engagement but also encourages a deeper connection between the player and the game.

I'm looking forward to finishing up my game engine over the summer. My immediate goal is to fully implement Box2D to enhance physics interactions within the engine. Looking ahead, I plan to expand the avatar builder to be more inclusive, allowing for high levels of customization and animations. 


Pragmatics
During the semester-long process of building a game engine, I experienced both challenges and successes. A significant highlight was the autograder for the course. It made it easy to pinpoint exactly where my mistakes were, which greatly accelerated my learning and progress.

The main thing that went wrong for me was losing time. I mentioned I fell behind around homework 5 due to a personal situation and that was hard to recover from and made it difficult to stay on track for later assignments. Though, I did greatly appreciate all of the assignments staying open until April.  

To improve my future development efforts, I'll start by making sure I fully understand the requirements before I begin coding. I've realized that I've wasted a fair amount of time by being too eager to dive into coding without fully grasping the specifications. 

This engine will definitely be a valuable addition to my portfolio. I'm eager to complete it fully so I can showcase its features and discuss the development process. When talking with recruiters, I'll emphasize the integration of Lua for scripting and the custom features I've implemented. 
Course Review
I believe I have become much more confident in C++ thanks to this course. This is the first large C++ project that I have built completely from scratch, and it has greatly contributed to my skills and confidence in the language.

My single biggest takeaway from the past few months is the immense value of the iterative design process. I've come to truly appreciate learning through trial and error. Additionally, a significant takeaway has been developing the ability to quickly identify and resolve linker and dynamic linker issues.

I truly appreciate the efforts from the course staff this semester. They did an amazing job launching this course and supporting us. Before this class, I wasn’t very interested in video games, much less game engines, but the staff’s enthusiasm really inspired me. That being said, there are a couple of things I would suggest changing. The first is the length of the exam. I understand the need for a thorough exam in a course like this, but I think it could have been a bit shorter. Also, it would be useful if the assignment specs mentioned which features we might drop in later assignments.

Thank you for reading and thank you GEA staff :D !!!!
