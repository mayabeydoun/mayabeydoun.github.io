                    <p>Developed for EECS 440 - XR and Society at the University of Michigan.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Express AR is an augmented reality experience designed to teach emotional learning through interactive storytelling and facial expression recognition. Players take on the role of an actor guided by a virtual director, completing scene-based challenges by expressing emotions like joy, sadness, and surprise using only their face.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The game encourages emotional development in neurodivergent children using playful, camera-based AR interactions. Players earn in-game rewards and unlock accessories as they progress through acting challenges.

                        <strong>Technologies Used:</strong><br>
                        - Unity with AR Foundation: Built the AR experience with real-time face tracking and UI interactions.<br>
                        - Barracuda & ONNX: Integrated emotion recognition using neural network inference directly in Unity.<br>
                        - C# Scripting: Developed all core logic including level systems, emotion detection, and dynamic reward feedback.<br>
                        - JIRA: Used for project management, tracking tasks, and organizing milestones.<br>

                <p>
                    <strong>An augmented reality (AR) experience designed to bring Ann Arbor to life through interactive location-based challenges. Players can customize their avatar and explore Ann Arbor while planting trees, battling squirrels, and collecting leaves!</strong>

                <p>
                    <strong>Technologies Utilized:</strong><br>
                    - Unity (AR Foundation): Used as the primary game engine to develop the AR experience, integrating real-world mapping and interactions.<br>
                    - Mapbox SDK: Implemented for real-time geolocation and navigation, allowing users to interact with specific Ann Arbor locations.<br>
                    - C# Scripting: Developed core game mechanics, including challenge logic, reward systems, and real-world interactions.<br>
                    - JIRA: Used for project management, tracking tasks, and organizing milestones.<br>
